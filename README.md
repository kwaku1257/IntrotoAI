# IntrotoAI
This repository contains projects and exercises I completed as part of my introduction to artificial intelligence. The focus areas include:
Machine Learning basics – supervised and unsupervised learning
Neural networks – simple feedforward and classification models
Python implementations – AI concepts applied with code
Practical projects – small experiments and problem-solving exercises
